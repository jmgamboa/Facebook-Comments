A wordpress plugin that saves all your facebook comments as native wordpress comemnts


TODO

Change the hardcode table prefix 'wp_posts' so a developer can set the prefix to their own table name

Setup as a wp cronjob so it will get all the comments

Set the the hardcode batch limits to something you want in getcomments.php and getreplies.php


Note* if you switch the out the prefix table names, then activate the plugin, the code should work out of the box
